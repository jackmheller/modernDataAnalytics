When strangers are coming...
They come to your house,
They kill you all
and say,
Weâ€™re not guilty
not guilty.
 
Where is your mind?
Humanity cries.
You think you are gods.
But everyone dies.
Don't swallow my soul.
Our souls
 
I did not enjoy my youth
I was not able to live in this place
I did not enjoy my youth
I was not able to live in this place
 
We could build a future
Where people are free
to live and love.
The happiest time.
 
Where is your heart?
Humanity rise.
You think you are gods
But everyone dies.
Don't swallow my soul.
Our souls
 
I did not enjoy my youth
I was not able to live in this place
I did not enjoy my youth
I was not able to live in this place
 
I did not enjoy my homeland
