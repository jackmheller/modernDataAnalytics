Oh oh, oh... oh, oh... oh, oh...
Oh oh, oh... oh, oh... oh, oh...
Come to me, come to me tonight
Oh God, I need you, anyway
Baby, I just wanna be, be around you all the time
Oh God, I need you, oh...
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
Come to me, come to me a bit more
Oh God, I need you
There's nothing left for me to say
So rest on me darling, stay forever more
Oh God, I need you, I need you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
Oh, what I wouldn't give away
To be your shelter and keep you safe
Keep you safe
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of life
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
I'm running, I'm scared tonight
I'm running, I'm scared of breathing
'Cause I adore you
And I'm running
And I'm running scared
'Cause I adore you
