Stefania mom, mom Stefania!
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray
Sing me the lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dear word

She was rocking me as a baby, she gave me a rhythm
And you can't take willpower from me, as I got it from her
I think she knew more than King Solomon
I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed
She wouldn't wake me, she wouldn't wake me, even if there was a storm outside
Or if there was a storm between her and grandma
She trusted me over everyone else, she was not deceived, even she was tired, she just kept rocking me
Lully-lully-lullaby...

Stefania mom, mom Stefania!
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray
Sing me the lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dear word

I'm not a kid anymore, but she will always treat me like one
I'm not a kid anymore, but she keeps worrying about me, anytime I'm out
Mother, you're still young, oh mom
If I don't appreciate your kindness, I'm moving towards a dead-end
But my love for you has no end
Lully-lully-lullaby...

Stefania mom, mom Stefania!
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray
Sing me the lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dear word
Stefania mom, mom Stefania!
The field is blooming, but her hair is getting gray
Sing me the lullaby, mom
I want to hear your dear word
