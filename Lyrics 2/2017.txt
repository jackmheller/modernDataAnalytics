If one day someone asks about me
Tell them I lived to love you
Before you, I only existed
Tired and with nothing to give

My dear, listen to my prayers
I beg you to return, to want me again
I know that one can't love alone
Maybe slowly you might learn again

My dear, listen to my prayers
I beg you to return, to want me again
I know that one can't love alone
Maybe slowly you might learn again

If your heart doesn't wish to give in
Not to feel passion, not to suffer
Without making plans of what will come after
My heart can love for the both of us
