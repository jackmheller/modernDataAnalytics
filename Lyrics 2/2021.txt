They don't know what I'm talking about
Clothes are dirty, bro, of mud
Cig's yellow in between the fingers
I'm walking with a cig
Pardon me, but I really do believe
That I can make this jump
And even if the street is uphill
I'm training for this now

And good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bring out the actors
You better hold on to your balls
You better keep quiet and be good
Here people are weird, like drug dealers
Too many nights I've spent locked outside
Now I'm kicking these doorways
Staring up like climbers
So sorry mum if I'm always out, but

I am out of my mind, but I'm not like the others
And you are out of your mind, but you're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others

I've written pages and pages
I've seen salt, then tears
These men in cars
Don't climb the rapids
I've written on a tombstone
"In my house there's no God"
But if you find time's meaning
You'll climb back up from your oblivion
And there's no wind stopping
The natural power
From the right point of view
You feel the intoxication of the wind
With wax wings on your back
I'll go look for that altitude
If you wanna stop me try again
Try cutting my head off
Because

I am out of my mind, but I'm not like the others
And you are out of your mind, but you're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others

Unfortunately people talk
They talk, they don't know what they talk about
Bring me where I float
Cause I lack air here
Unfortunately people talk
They talk, they don't know what they talk about
Bring me where I float
Cause I lack air here
Unfortunately people talk
They talk, they don't know what the fuck they talk about
Bring me where I float
Cause I lack air here

But I am out of my mind, but I'm not like the others
And you are out of your mind, but you're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others

We are not like the others
