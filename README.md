The files "armed conflict where at least one party is the government" and "attacks on civilians by governments" were found on https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/. However they mostly show confilcts in Arika/Asia, with just few cases in eastern Europe.

Data on country border can be found on: https://github.com/geodatasource/country-borders, couldn't download it however. 

The Data Population_by_Language was found on http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:27, this data is also seperated by gender, so we would need to edit this accordingly. Similar data can be found on https://wals.info/languoid. 

The Jupiter Notebook on the Eurovision data can be found on: https://neo4j.com/graphgists/eurovision-votes/.
