The files "armed conflict where at least one party is the government" and "attacks on civilians by governments" were found on https://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/. However they mostly show confilcts in Arika/Asia, with just few cases in eastern Europe.

Data on country border can be found on: https://github.com/geodatasource/country-borders, couldn't download it however.
